## Veterinary_Management_System_Design
# Overview
This project presents the full analysis and design of a Veterinary Information and Management System built to improve data centralization, appointment scheduling, billing accuracy, inventory tracking, and customer communication for a veterinary clinic.

The goal was to design an integrated system that reduces manual errors, improves efficiency, and supports secure data management.

# Problem 
The clinic relied on spreadsheets, manual scheduling, and disconnected systems. 
This created:
 - Medical record inconsistencies
 - Missed or double-booked appointments
 - Manual billing errors
 - Poor inventory tracking
 - Limited data accessibility

# Solution 
The proposed VIMS system centralizes:
 - Pet medical records
 - Appointment scheduling
 - Billing and payment tracking
 - Inventory management
 - Customer communication

# Key Features Designed
 - Role-based access for Staff, Vet, and Pet Owner
 - Centralized pet medical record management
 - Online appointment booking with reminders
 - Automated invoice generation and payment tracking
 - Real-time inventory tracking with low-stock alerts
 - Secure authentication and data validation
